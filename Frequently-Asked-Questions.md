## Answers

#### I’ve signed up to OpenStreetMap and its showing a map but how do I get to the area you want us to map?

The first time you log in, OpenStreetMap might not direct you to the correct location. If this happens then simply close the tab, click *"I've given up mapping this square"* and get a new square (it might even give you the same one!).

#### I have clicked on a feature (e.g. a hut or a path) to classify it, and it is not giving me the classification options that I need

This is probably that you have clicked on one of the little white dots that make up the feature, which OpenStreetMap sees as different from the feature itself. If you click on the feature itself (avoiding the dots) - such as the middle of a hut or the line between the dots, then you should see the options that you are looking for.

#### I am right-clicking on a hut/building to make it circular/square, and it is not giving me the menu that I am expecting.

It is likely that you are right-clicking on one of the little white dots that make up the feature, which OpenStreetMap sees as different from the feature itself. If you right-click on the feature itself on the middle of a hut (rather than the dots around the edge), then you should see the circularise or squarify option.

#### What happens if I’m not sure how to label what I’ve mapped? e.g. if I’m not sure if it’s a track, minor road etc. Can I save it with edits to be checked?

We check all of the data that our volunteers create (please *do not* tick the box asking OpenStreetMap to check this - as we will already do it) . We know that sometimes it is very difficult even for experienced mappers to tell how to classify features, so all that we ask is that you make your best judgement. Even if you are totally wrong, the geometry is valuable, and it won't be long before it is checked and fixed!

#### OpenStreetmap is telling me my track doesn’t join up to anything but it runs on outside my square, is it ok just to track part of a road/track and save it?

This is fine - where possible, it is good to connect lines to other lines, but if this is not possible (i.e. because there is nothing to connect it to) then it is perfectly fine to leave it for someone else to connect in the future. The warnings are just there to ensure that you haven't forgotten to connect them by accident - they can be safely ignored if there is nothing to connect to *(as the person who maps the adjacent square will likely connect them in the future!)*.

#### I’ve started a road/track line then accidentally double clicked to finish, how do I go back to editing it/ continuing with it?

No problem, simply select the **line** tool again, and start your new line at the end of the previous one - it will seamlessly extend the original line - you can then set it to have the same classification, and this will be no different to if you had drawn it all in one go in the first place.

#### I noticed I went wrong on a section, but I’ve since mapped some other sections of my square, how do I delete it without losing my other work?

Absolutely, you can simply either:

* left-click on any feature and edit either its geometry or classfication, just the same as when you were creating it
* right-click on any feature and select the bin icon to delete it
* left click on it and press the delete button on your keyboard to delete it

#### Is it ok if I don’t complete everything in the square? (I know you answer this, I just think it’ll come up!)

This is fine, just be sure to click the red *"I've given up mapping this square"* button on the **community mapping.org** tab, and someone else will complete it for you later!
